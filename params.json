Wumpus has the following characteristics:\r\n* Three(3) working modes: Normal, Faster, Debug.\r\n* Random squares with Wumpus, Agent, Gold and Pit.\r\n* Random squares with stench, shiny and breeze feelings.\r\n* The agent infers based on their feelings.\r\n\r\nData is displayed in console with several options (normal, faster, debug).\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n![Main Window](http://i.imgur.com/77LvL4S.png)\r\n![Game](http://i.imgur.com/9HqROZC.png)\r\n\r\n## Building\r\n\r\nWumpus can be compiled with any compiler that supports C++.\r\n\r\n",
