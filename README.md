Wumpus game, programmed in [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B). 

I programed this little game years ago when I started to studying AI. 

Wumpus is a classic and funny AI game in which the Hero has to pick a bag of gold or kill the the wild and savage Wumpus beast. Wumpus has the following characteristics:
* Three(3) working modes: Normal, Faster, Debug.
* Random squares with Wumpus, Agent, Gold and Pit.
* Random squares with stench, shiny and breeze feelings.
* The agent infers based on their feelings.

Data is displayed in console with several options (normal, faster, debug).
